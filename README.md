## Installation
Confirm you have mongoDB installed correctly. Clone this repository to your machine and open it in your IDE. In the terminal, run this command to confirm npm is installed:

```

```

Once it finishes, run this command to run the project:

```
npm start
```

Once running, you can use a program like [**Insomnia Core**](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the routes.
